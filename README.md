# music-db
hw3

To Use:
1. Activate the virtual environment present in music-db-hw3/venv
2. In one command line, CD into the main directory and then "frontend" and run "npm start"
3. In another command line, CD into the main directory and then "backend" and run "python3 manage.py runserver"
4. The site should be accessible at localhost:3000 now.

The additional feature we added is the ability to submit music files tailored to songs and play them using the "Play" button. You will be prompted to add a file when adding a new song.

Work on this homework was distributed evenly.
